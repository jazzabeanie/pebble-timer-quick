Read `./docs/button-functions.md` for a complete reference of all button functions across every control mode, including which tests verify each behavior. Ensure that button-functions.md is kept up to date after any changes after any changes are made.

When developing a feature or a bug fix, following these steps:

1. Create tests that are expected to fail
2. Run the tests and confirm that they fail
3. Implement the feature or fix
4. Re-run the tests and confirm that they pass
