# pebble-timer-plus
Timer+ is a beautiful, simple timer for the Pebble Smartwatch. It will run in the background, using the WakeUp api, 
so there is no need to keep the app open. Once the timer has gone off, or even while it is running, long pressing
the select button will reset the timer. Additionally, starting a timer from 0:00 will cause Timer+ to go into 
stopwatch mode.
